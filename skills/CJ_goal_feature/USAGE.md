# Skill Usage: CJ_goal_feature

## When to use

- "build a feature", "build this feature end-to-end", "ship a feature end-to-end",
  "one-line idea to a reviewable PR", "topic to PR"
- You have a plain feature topic (one-line) and want a reviewable PR at the end
- Resume: re-invoking the same verb on the same branch picks up where you left off
  (state file records `last_completed_phase` + per-phase HEAD SHA + PR number;
  validates-before-skipping)
- `--dry-run` previews the chain plan without mutation
- `--no-sync` skips the pre-build skills-sync (F000045) for a faster start; the
  worktree's local-main fast-forward still runs

## When NOT to use

- The work is a bug, not a feature — use `/CJ_goal_defect`
- The work is already tracked as a TODOS.md row — use `/CJ_goal_todo_fix`
- You want auto-merge after PR — not supported by design; the handoff-gate
  denylist makes auto-merge unsafe-by-construction; PR-stop is correct here
- You want plan review or eng/CEO/design review — those are separate gstack
  skills; this orchestrator is build-end-to-end-to-PR, not plan-review

## Mental model

A fresh-base build start (F000045): the preamble first runs a pre-build
skills-sync (`cj-goal-common.sh --phase sync` → `post-land-sync.sh`'s guarded
pull + `skills-deploy install` from `.source`, fail-soft) so installed skills
match trunk, then the worktree phase fast-forwards local `main` to `origin/main`
before `git worktree add` so the build branches off current trunk (Fork 1, in
`cj-worktree-init.sh`). Both halves never block the build — offline / divergence
/ guard refusal all proceed with a one-line `[sync]` / `note` advisory.

Then: one interactive phase (`/office-hours` inline, emits APPROVED design doc),
silent leaf subagents (scaffold → implement → QA; QA runs the doc/test audits
inline at its Step 8.6), the QA-audit checkpoint AUQ (Step 3.4 — fires ALWAYS
after QA green with the AUDIT_FINDINGS digest; Continue past findings journals
`[qa-audit-waived]`, Halt journals `[qa-audit-declined]` / `halted_at_qa_audit`
— the one AUQ past the design gate), `/CJ_document-release`
(Step 5.5 doc-sync) inline, a pre-ship portability gate (Step 5.7,
`cj-goal-common.sh --phase portability-audit`, run STRICT) that HALTs on a
dishonest skill portability declaration BEFORE any PR is opened, then `/ship`
inline (with diff-review AUQ suppressed) → STOPS at the open PR. The PR is the
architecture gate (human review). Worktree-on-main creates `cj-feat-*` worktree
automatically. Halt taxonomy: `green_pr_opened`, `halted_at_*` (including
`halted_at_qa_audit` + `halted_at_portability`), `already_shipped` with
`next_action=` / `resume_cmd=`
/ `pr_url=` journal entries.

## Common pitfalls

- Expecting the PR to merge automatically — it won't; `/ship` Gate #2 is human,
  and `/land-and-deploy` is a separate manual step here
- Abandoning the /office-hours phase (not APPROVED) and expecting the chain to
  proceed — it HALTs by design
- Re-invoking on a branch with a force-pushed history — resume validates-before-
  skipping; if the recorded SHA isn't ancestor-of current HEAD, the affected
  phase restarts
- Running it on a non-macOS host — workbench-only
- A touched skill that declares a portability tier it does not honor — the
  Step 5.7 portability gate HALTs (`halted_at_portability`) before the PR; relabel
  the skill's `portability` (or add the dep to `portability_requires`) in
  skills-catalog.json and re-run
- Expecting `--no-sync` to also skip the base fast-forward — it does not; `--no-sync`
  only suppresses the heavy `skills-deploy install`, Fork-1's local-main ff still runs
- Expecting the pre-build sync or ff to halt on failure — both are fail-soft by
  design (offline / divergence / guard refusal proceed; the build is never blocked)

## Related skills

- `/office-hours` (upstream gstack) — the one interactive phase
- `/CJ_scaffold-work-item` — silent leaf subagent (Phase 3.1)
- `/CJ_implement-from-spec` — silent leaf subagent (Phase 3.2)
- `/CJ_qa-work-item` — silent leaf subagent (Phase 3.3); its Step 8.6 runs
  `/CJ_doc_audit` + `/CJ_test_audit` inline and feeds the Step 3.4 checkpoint
- `/ship` (upstream gstack) — inline final step; opens PR with diff-review AUQ
- `/CJ_goal_defect` — sibling top-level verb for bug-from-description
- `/CJ_goal_todo_fix` — sibling top-level verb for TODOS.md drains
