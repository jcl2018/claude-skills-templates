# test-spec.md — the general test contract

This file is the single answer to one question: **what rules is this repo's
verification surface held to?** It is both the human-readable statement (the
prose below) and the machine source of truth (the fenced `yaml` registry at
the end), parsed by `test-spec.sh` (resolved `spec/test-spec.md` first, then a
root `test-spec.md` fallback).

This file is the **general tier** of a two-tier contract, delivered verbatim
(`test-spec.sh --seed` emits it byte-for-byte). A repo adopts the contract by
dropping in this file — and never editing it: repo-specific test logic — the
unit-level enumeration of the verification surface (every validator check,
test sub-suite, CI workflow, git hook) — lives in an optional
**`test-spec-custom.md` overlay** next to this file (`units:` rows in the same
fenced-yaml grammar). The parser merges the two internally, so consumers see
ONE registry. An overlay-absent repo carries the rules alone: the coverage
cross-check stays **inactive** until `units:` rows exist, and tooling reports
that state by name instead of inventing findings.

## The five general rules

| Rule | What it asserts |
|------|-----------------|
| `tests-discoverable` | every test file under the repo's test dir(s) is wired into a runner declared by a `units:` row — no silent skips |
| `suite-green` | the declared full-suite runner passes before ship |
| `new-code-tested` | a change that adds behavior carries test rows covering it |
| `units-anchored` | every declared unit's anchor greps in its declared source (forward coverage) |
| `single-owner` | every live test surface resolves to exactly one declared unit (reverse coverage) |

Two enforcement layers stand behind the rules:

- **Deterministic** — `test-spec.sh --check-coverage` mechanizes
  `units-anchored` / `single-owner` / `tests-discoverable` wherever `units:`
  rows exist: forward, every unit's `anchor` must match LIVE in its declared
  `source`; reverse, every live test surface must resolve to exactly one unit;
  floor, the reverse extraction must keep yielding a healthy token count so
  grammar rot can never make the check vacuously pass.
- **Agent-judged** — `suite-green` and `new-code-tested` are judged against the
  repo's current state by the test audit (a red suite or behavior-adding code
  without covering test rows is a finding), layered ABOVE the deterministic
  floor, never replacing it.

## Machine registry

The block below is the source of truth. Keep it the only fenced `yaml` block in
this file.

```yaml
# test-spec registry (parsed by test-spec.sh; merged with the optional
# test-spec-custom.md overlay; consumed by a CI validator + a test-audit skill)
schema_version: 1
rules:
  - id: tests-discoverable
    statement: "Every test file under the repo's test dir(s) (default tests/) is wired into a runner declared by a units: row — a test file on disk that no runner invokes silently never runs."
    scope: "every test file on disk"
    enforced_by: "test-spec.sh --check-coverage reverse sweep (active when units: rows exist)"
  - id: suite-green
    statement: "The declared full-suite runner passes before ship."
    scope: "the whole verification surface"
    enforced_by: "agent-judged by the test audit / QA (a red suite is a finding)"
  - id: new-code-tested
    statement: "A change that adds behavior carries test rows covering it."
    scope: "every behavior-adding change"
    enforced_by: "agent-judged by the test audit / QA (code-without-units drift is a finding)"
  - id: units-anchored
    statement: "Every declared unit's anchor matches LIVE in its declared source file (forward coverage — dead-text mentions do not count)."
    scope: "every units: row"
    enforced_by: "test-spec.sh --check-coverage forward anchor-grep"
  - id: single-owner
    statement: "Every live test surface resolves to exactly one declared unit (reverse coverage)."
    scope: "every live validator banner/comment, test file on disk, CI workflow, installed hook"
    enforced_by: "test-spec.sh --check-coverage reverse sweep + floor (active when units: rows exist)"
```
