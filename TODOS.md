## Deferred work

Superseded by collection versioning. Templates are covered by the collection version.

### ~~Skill authoring harness skill (P1, M)~~ RETIRED
Shipped as v0.1.0, then sunset in v0.2.3. Replaced by /office-hours + implement + /ship workflow.

### ~~Skill authoring enhancements (P3, S)~~ RETIRED
Depends on skill-author which was removed.

### ~~GitHub Actions CI for skill lifecycle (P3, S)~~ RETIRED

### ~~Add `/docs check` and `/docs tree` to Phase 3 review gates (P2, S)~~ DONE
Already present in all 4 tracker templates. Phase 3 gates include `/docs check` and
`/docs tree` (feature/user-story) or `/docs check` (task/defect).

### validate.sh structural check via graph JSON (P2, M)
Add structural completeness check to validate.sh by reading `work-item-graph.json`
badges instead of doing its own YAML parsing. Catches structural violations in
pre-commit, not just when someone runs `/docs check`.
**When:** After graph artifact schema (v1.0.0) is proven stable.
**Depends on:** `.docs/work-item-graph.json` emitted by `/docs check` Steps 15-17.

### Behavioral eval harness (P1, M) — PRIORITY
Golden tasks, expected outputs, regression fixtures, safety checks per skill.
Measures whether a skill actually works, not just whether metadata exists.
**When:** Next priority.
**Depends on:** validate.sh

### ~~Batch version mode for multi-skill commits (P3, S)~~ SIMPLIFIED
Simplified by collection versioning. Use `collection-version.sh bump patch`.
**Depends on:** collection-version.sh
